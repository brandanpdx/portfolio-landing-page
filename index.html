          <h3>Why I chose Epicodus</h3>
          <p>One of the most unique aspects of how Epicodus classrooms works is that students practice pair programming, where two people use the same computer at the same time. One person drives, controlling the keyboard and mouse, and the other person watches and talks. Typically, students are pairing with a different partner each day.</p>
          <p>This collaborative approach solidified my decisiong to enroll at Epicodus. </p>
