          <h2>Why I chose <strong>Epicodus</strong></h2>
          <p>One of the most unique aspects of how Epicodus classrooms works is that students practice pair programming, where two people use the same computer at the same time. One person drives,controlling the keyboard and mouse, and the other person watches and talks. Typically students are pairing with a different partner each
            day.</p>
          <p>This collaborative approach solidified my decisiong to enroll at Epicodus. </p>

          <h2>My extracurricular: <em>photography</em></h2>
          <p>Photography for me began with this fear of myself as a hermit and a search for a tool that would put me in a position to have to be out engaging with the world everyday. Then it became this portal to and catalyst for reckoning with the other and how the camera can be used to breaking down barriers between the photographer, subject and viewer.</p>
